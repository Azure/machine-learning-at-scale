# HyperParameter Tuning HyperBand with NNI

This example shows how to use NNI to perform hyperparameter tuning with HyperBand on Azure Machine Learning.

## Prerequisites

- Azure Machine Learning Workspace
    - Compute Clusters for parallel training
    - Compute Instance with Azure ML CLI 2.0 and NNI library installed

## HPO with NNI

Neural Network Intelligence (NNI) is a library that provides a unified interface for hyperparameter optimization. Many tuning algorithm is included. See the following link for more details in reference section.
